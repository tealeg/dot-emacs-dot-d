* tealeg’s personal Emacs configuration
** You probably don’t want this
... at least not all of it, some of it is very specific to me.  Still,
you might be interested in how I do certain things, and that you can
find in these files.

** Prerequisites
- You need a Linux machine, I’ve not tested on OS X or Windows, who
  uses that crap?
- You need an ~/.authinfo.gpg file with IRC log-in details, Disqus
  details and Google Analytics details.  I don’t include these things
  in the lisp so I’m not exposing passwords, or indeed storing them in
  plain text on my machine.

** How to install
1. Exit Emacs
2. Execute the following in a terminal:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d-old
  git clone https://github.com/tealeg/dot-emacs-dot-d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
3. Start Emacs.
