* Backups
** Overview
Emacs makes automatic backups of files you edit.  Configuration
options controlling that process live here.

** Set configuration options
By default emacs puts a single backup file next to the file you're
editing.  This litters the filesystem and is, on the whole, annoying.
Lets put them elsewhere.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . "~/.saves")))
#+END_SRC

Make copies to backup files being edited, rather than renaming the file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-by-copying t)
#+END_SRC

Clear down old backup versions, silently.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq delete-old-versions t)
#+END_SRC

Keep the 6 most recent versions of the file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq kept-new-versions 6)
#+END_SRC

Keep the 2 oldest versions of the file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq kept-old-versions 2) 
#+END_SRC	

Use numeric values to differentiate version of backed up files.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq version-control t)
#+END_SRC

** Provide the feature
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'tealeg-backups)
#+END_SRC
