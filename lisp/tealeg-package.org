* Packages 
** Overview
Emacs has a package management system (like every decent OS ;-) ).


** Add MELPA to the package-archives list if it's missing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (unless (assoc-default "melpa" package-archives)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
		 '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
    ;; (package-refresh-contents)  ; Only do this once, it's not needed every load time.
    )
#+END_SRC

** Ensure we have =use-package=.
=use-package= is a very helpful extension that handles installing
missing packages and lazy-loading of files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
 (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
     (package-install 'use-package))
#+END_SRC

We also need to set-up some configuration for =use-package=.

Keep =use-package= from flooding me with information, I'd toggle this
for debugging purposes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-verbose nil)
#+END_SRC

Always ensure the package is installed.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Provide the feature
A good habit to be in.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'tealeg-packages)
#+END_SRC
