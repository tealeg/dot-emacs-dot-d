* Automatic compilation of emacs lisp
** Overview
This helps to keep .elc files up-to date, and .elc files make things
load more quickly.

** Use the auto-compile package
I used to handle all this in my own code, but as there's a package for
it now, I'll use that instead. Progress, ain't it grand!
#+BEGIN_SRC 
  (use-package auto-compile
    :config (auto-compile-on-load-mode))
  (setq load-prefer-newer t)

#+END_SRC

** Provide the feature
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'tealeg-autocompile)
#+END_SRC
