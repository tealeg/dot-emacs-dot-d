* Variable customisation system
** Overview
Emacs has a built in 'settings' UI called =customize=. Any tweaks we
make to the configuration of that system belong here, the settings it
sets are stored in a special file.

** Put emacs customisations in their own file.
By default, emacs puts the customisations in your root emacs
configuration file (=.emacs= or =.emacs.d/init.el=). That's annoying
and ugly, so I put them in their own special file that I can easily
put in my =.gitignore= file too.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/emacs-custom.el")
  (load custom-file t)
#+END_SRC

** Provide the feature
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'tealeg-custom)
#+END_SRC
